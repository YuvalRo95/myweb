          <h2>Vitamins and Minerals</h2>
          <p>
            Kiwi crushes oranges having double the vitamin C. And those perfect
            red strawberries? Crushed as well. Kiwis are packed with vitamin E
            and K. Much more than you'd find in apples, bananas, and
            blueberries. Did you know the vitamin E content is twice that of
            avocado? And if that wasn't even enough, have a look at the minerals
            A single kiwi has AS MUCH potassium as 1 medium sized banana. Kiwi
            is also an excellent source of folic acid. And it scores really good
            for copper as well. But what about benefits of including Kiwis in
            your diet?

          <h2>Kiwi for Dieting section</h2>
          <p>
            Kiwi is relatively low in calories, making it a good choice for
            those who are trying to control their calorie intake. A medium-sized
            kiwi typically contains about 50-60 calories. High in Fiber: Kiwi is
            a good source of dietary fiber, including both soluble and insoluble
            fibers. Fiber helps in promoting a feeling of fullness, which can be
            beneficial for weight management by reducing overall calorie intake.

          <p>
            Turns out just eating Kiwis can reduce the incidence and symptoms of
            the common cold and flu! If that isn't awesome, I don't know what
            is. Now, we all know how vital Sleep is for health and fitness. Can
            you name one fruit that helps you sleep better? I couldn't until I
            learned thisâ€¦ Research showed that eating kiwis can help with
            transitioning into sleep. It also increases duration and quality of
            sleep. The awesomeness doesn't stop there.
